At an eviction party for the building Zac is introduced to
Stacey Anderson, a director at MAS, who after touring the site
truly understands the potential and agrees to help with the
nascent project. Two weeks later while co-leading a tour of
the neighborhood in commemoration of Jane Jacobs, Stacey
introduces Zac to fellow urbanist Karen Zabarsky and the Maker
Park founding team is complete.
