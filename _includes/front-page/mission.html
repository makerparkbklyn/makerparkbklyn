					<p>Maker Park is a vision for an adaptive reuse park along
						the Williamsburg waterfront that captures the creative
						ethos of the neighborhood around it, and reflects its
						rich history by breathing new life into the site's
						industrial fabric. The idea springs from an awareness
						that both our waterfront heritage and the local
						creative community is being wiped away at alarming
						speed.</p>
					<p>We also believe that parks have the potential
						to be much more than two-dimensional green spaces.
						Maker Park is poised to achieve the acute community
						need for green open space while also serving as a
						dynamic, interactive, and educational public park that
						speaks to Brooklynâ€™s past, present, and future.</p>
