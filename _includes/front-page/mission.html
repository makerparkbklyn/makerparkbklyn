				<p>Maker Park is a vision for an adaptive reuse park along
					the Williamsburg waterfront that captures the creative
					ethos of the neighborhood around it, and reflects its
					rich history by breathing new life into the site's
					industrial fabric. The idea springs from an awareness
					that both our waterfront heritage and the local
					creative community is being wiped away at alarming
					speed.</p>

				<p>We also believe that parks have the potential
					to be much more than two-dimensional green spaces.
					Maker Park is poised to achieve the acute community
					need for green open space while also serving as a
					dynamic, interactive, and educational public park that
					speaks to Brooklynâ€™s past, present, and future.</p>
