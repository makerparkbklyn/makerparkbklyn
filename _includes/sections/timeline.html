			<h3>1867</h3>
			<p>At the height of Brooklyn’s Industrial Revolution,
				American businessman and petroleum pioneer, Charles
				Pratt, founds Astral Oil Works on the site of the
				proposed Maker Park, now known as the Bayside Fuel
				Terminal.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="timeline-carousel__item" data-date="1870&ndash;1874">
			<h3>1870&ndash;1874</h3>
			<p>The success of Astral puts Pratt in rival with John
				D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil, which eventually absorbs
				the company. Pratt uses his newfound fortune to found
				and endow Pratt Institute, a vocational school that
				seeks to train the emerging industrial workforce.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="timeline-carousel__item" data-date="1900s">
			<h3>1900s</h3>
			<p>Brooklyn continues to be the epicenter of industrial
				expansion, until the second half of the century, which
				is marked by decades of decline. While the refinery
				remains active, much of the waterfront sits derelict
				and in decay.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="timeline-carousel__item" data-date="1990&ndash;2000s">
			<h3>1990&ndash;2000s</h3>
			<p>Amid dilapidated structures and overgrown pavement,
				a group of locals reclaim the waterfront as a haven for
				recreation and self-expression, transforming it into a
				unique civic space for the neighborhood.  The building
				on the Bayside Fuel Terminal comes to house a creative
				community of artists and entrepreneurs.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="timeline-carousel__item" data-date="2005">
			<h3>2005</h3>
			<p>Mayor Bloomberg sees incredible potential to
				capitalize on this underutilized stretch of land and
				puts forth a Waterfront Rezoning Agreement. In exchange
				for allowing new residential development along the
				water, his administration promises the community a
				28-acre park from North 6th to the Bushwick Inlet,
				called Bushwick Inlet Park.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="timeline-carousel__item" data-date="2007">
			<h3>2007</h3>
			<p>Post-rezoning, the neighborhood sees a surge of new
				residential development. The National Trust for Historic
				Preservation sounds the alarm and declares Brooklyn’s
				industrial waterfront one of America’s 11 most
				endangered historic places.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="timeline-carousel__item" data-date="2011">
			<h3>2011</h3>
			<p>Piecemeal acquisition of waterfront property results
				in the first completed phase of Bushwick Inlet Park, a
				multipurpose athletic field stretching between N 9th
				and N 10th. Much of the promised park however remains
				derelict, while property values continue to rise in the
				face of Williamsburg's newfound popularity.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="timeline-carousel__item" data-date="October 2014">
			<h3>October 2014</h3>
			<p>The City moves to complete the purchase of the
				Bayside Fuel Terminal, a parcel of the promised park
				which results in eviction notices to tenants on site.
				Zac Waldman, an occupant of the building for nearly a
				decade, while attempting to preserve the creative
				community existing in the building, starts to explore
				the site and tanks and begins to envision an alternate
				concept for the eventual park.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="timeline-carousel__item" data-date="January 2015">
			<h3>January 2015</h3>
			<p>An 11 acre site owned by businessman Norm Brodsky is
				the last puzzle piece needed to complete park. A massive
				6-alarm fire breaks out in a warehouse on the site,
				re-igniting heated debate around the City's unfulfilled
				promise. With local park advocates like Friends of
				Bushwick Inlet Park leading the charge, the community
				urges follow-through on a Community Benefit agreement
				made a decade prior.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="timeline-carousel__item" data-date="April 2015">
			<h3>April 2015</h3>
			<p>At an eviction party for the building Zac is
				introduced to Stacey Anderson, a director at MAS, who
				after touring the site truly understands the potential
				and agrees to help with the nascent project. Two weeks
				later while co-leading a tour of the neighborhood in
				commemoration of Jane Jacobs, Stacey introduces Zac to
				fellow urbanist Karen Zabarsky and the Maker Park
				founding team is complete.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="timeline-carousel__item" data-date="Summer 2015">
			<h3>Summer 2015</h3>
			<p>The group begins uncovering the site’s history—and
				its incredible connection to Pratt Institute—researching
				its environmental status, reaching out to local
				stakeholders, and seeking council from experts.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="timeline-carousel__item" data-date="Fall 2015">
			<h3>Fall 2015</h3>
			<p>Seeing great potential in the vision, a dream team of
				professionals sign on to lend their expertise pro-bono
				to the project, spearheaded by Studio V Architecture.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="timeline-carousel__item" data-date="Summer 2016">
			<h3>Summer 2016</h3>
			<p>Alongside this outreach, the team investigates the
				feasibility of remediating the sites with structures in
				place, given its complicated environmental status as a
				former refinery.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="timeline-carousel__item" data-date="Fall 2016">
			<h3>Fall 2016</h3>
			<p>After months of tense negotiations, the City finally
				reaches a $160 million deal to purchase the final parcel
				of waterfront property, an outstanding victory for the community. With the
				contiguous 28 acre stretch of land now in the City’s
				possession, our team seeks to examine the site as it
				currently exists and ask what would make for a truly
				21st century park, uniquely of and for Brooklyn?
